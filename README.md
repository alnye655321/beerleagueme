## __beerleague.me__
#### A phonegap android/iOS application
### Description
Currently, coordinating a kickball team for a local league is a practice in disorganization. It involves word-of-mouth recruiting and a combination of SMS and email communication. Our platform streamlines this process and consolidates the experience of recreational, ‘beer-league’ sports.
